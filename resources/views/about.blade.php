                    <p>So you love the beach, but you’re tired of bobbing around on your Walmart bodyboard and getting slammed into the sand by every other wave. You gaze enviously at seasoned surfers as they effortlessly duck under the foam and gracefully glide across wave after wave. Lucky for you, learning to surf in Los Angeles is pretty easy. With plenty of beautiful beaches.</p>
                    <p>and local instructors willing to share their knowledge.there’s no reason why you can’t go from kook to pro in no time.</p>
                    <p>We spoke to two experts from surfing schools in Los Angeles, Allen King of Aqua Surf School and Nick Fowler of Aloha Brothers, to get the lowdown on what you need to know before you hit the water.</p>
